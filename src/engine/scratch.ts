// Reusable per-runtime scratch storage for the render hot path. The web
// original allocated a fresh Dot object (plus a projection tuple) per dot
// per frame; at 60 fps × many orbs that is tens of thousands of short-
// lived objects per second on the UI-thread Hermes heap. Instead, dots
// live in structure-of-arrays Float32Array buffers that are created once
// per JS runtime and reused by every orb: the UI thread runs derived
// values sequentially and each build → record pass completes atomically
// inside one invocation, so a shared buffer can never interleave between
// orbs.
