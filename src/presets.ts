  // frame budget. Cost is ~linear in the dot count and nothing else moves it.

  // The corollary, learned the expensive way: a SIMULATOR reading is not
  // evidence here. The same shell measured 5.0 ms build+record on an iPhone 17
  // Pro Max simulator and looked affordable, because that runs on a Mac's CPU.
  // Only a release build on a phone answers this question.
