// VoiceOrb — the voice shell, driven by a voice agent's lifecycle.
//
// Takes the state a voice SDK already emits plus the two audio levels, and
// resolves them to a behaviour on the shared dot shell (see
// `engine/voice.ts`). Because every behaviour acts on the same dots, a
// state change is a BLEND rather than a cut: the dots travel from one
// behaviour to the next over a few hundred milliseconds, which matters
// when an agent flips listening → thinking → speaking several times a
// turn.
//
// The state union is LiveKit's `AgentState` verbatim — the full client-side
// one, including the connection phases — so a session state passes straight
// through. Other SDKs use a subset of the same words.
